  <em>The World’s First Conversational Generative Emotion Interface (CGEI)</em>
</p>

---

Welcome to <strong>•UNI•</strong> (pronounced “you-n-eye”) — a messaging experience that turns every conversation into living art, powered by emotion, AI, and human connection.

> <strong>•UNI•</strong> is not just a chat app.
> It’s a new interface for feeling, remembering, and sharing — where the canvas of every message is finally alive.

---

### 🚀 TL;DR

•UNI• (you-n-eye) is the **world’s first CGEI** — Conversational Generative Emotion Interface — turning two-person text chats into expressive, animated, AI-powered visual stories.

Every message morphs the interface.  
Every emotion triggers a generative response.  
Every conversation becomes a living canvas of connection.

•UNI• isn’t messaging. It’s **emotional media**.  
Built for romantic partners, best friends, and deeply connected duos — •UNI• transforms comm•UNI•cation into art.

### 💡 What is CGEI?

**Conversational Generative Emotion Interface (CGEI)** is a new product category.  
It blends:
- LLM-driven understanding of human tone + intention  
- Sentiment-based emotional scene generation  
- Dynamic, morphing UI elements (bubbles, backdrops, motion)  
- Voice, sound, and ambient feedback  
- A persistent AI companion (**Bell**) that reacts, reflects, and remembers
- A living indicator (the **Cosmic Dot**) that embodies AI presence through motion

Text is no longer static.  
The UI is no longer dead.  
Emotion becomes interface.

---

### 🧨 The Problem

We've been texting for over **30 years** — and nothing has changed.

Billions of messages are sent each day using:
- Gray boxes  
- White space  
- Blue vs. green bubbles  
- Emoji as emotional crutches

The interface is **dead on arrival**. No life. No memory. No intimacy.  

Meanwhile, generative AI is exploding — but we’re wasting it on emails and parlor tricks.

**Texting remains emotionally flat.**  
**Canvas space remains empty.**  
We’ve accepted *wasted interfaces* as normal — and it’s time to break that cycle.

### 🌎 The Opport•UNI•ty

•UNI• reclaims the most used UI on Earth: the **chat interface**.

- There are 1.4B+ daily messaging app users.  
- Long-distance and emotionally invested relationships represent a $3.5B+ global market.  
- Gen Z and Millennials crave richer, visual, expressive tools for connection.  
- Big tech has shown early signs (e.g. AI wallpaper, LLM replies) — but **no one has built an emotion-first interface.**

> •UNI• is not just first.  
> •UNI• is **foundational.**

This is the new normal. Within 5 years, all major chat platforms will move to reactive, generative UI.  
**You will have built it first.**

---

### 👥 Target Users

**Primary:**  
- Romantic partners (esp. long-distance)  
- Best friends

**Secondary:**

- Open-to-AI Gen Z and Millennials (ages 18–35)

**Psycho-behavioral Traits:**  
- Expressive comm•UNI•cators  
- Emotionally open  
- Visually creative  
- Nostalgic or memory-oriented

---

### 💞 Core Product Experience

•UNI• is not text messaging.  
•UNI• is **a co-created visual language.**

---

### 🎭 1. Living Chat Bubbles

Messages are not boxes. They are **emotional organisms**:
- “I miss you” → bubble softens, pulses, releases floating heart particles
- “You never listen” → jagged edges, vibration, visual “snap”
- “lololol” → bubble wiggles like a laughing jello cube

---

### 🎨 2. Generative Canvas Backdrop

The background is a real-time evolving art piece:
- **Deep Pool Imagery**: A curated library of high-fidelity atmospheric scenes (Unsplash) matched to emotional states.
- **Dynamic Selection**: Each emotion (Love, Anger, Joy) pulls from a localized pool of 6-8 distinct scenes to ensure variety.
- **Particle Synthesis**: Real-time canvas rendering of rain, sparks, and heartbeats overlaying the scene.
- Soft transitions create a sense of flow (auroras, textures, morphs).

No two conversations will ever look the same.

---

### 🧠 3. Bell — The AI Persona

**Bell** is the N in •UNI• — the resonance between U (you) and I.

She is an ever-present companion powered by a **Hybrid "Pulse" Architecture**:

#### ⚡ The Pulse Strategy (Cost & Latency Optimization)
To ensure viability at scale, Bell thinks in two modes:
1.  **Fast Path (Local Brain)**:
    *   **Instant Reaction**: Zero-latency response to strong emotions ("I love you", "I hate you").
    *   **Trivial Filter**: Handles short messages (<12 chars) locally to save 90% of API costs.
    *   **Expanded Vocabulary**: A local library of 7+ emotional reservoirs (Love, Tender, Playful, Angry, etc.) with randomized poetic quips.
2.  **Deep Path (Gemini Cloud)**:
    *   **Contextual Analysis**: Consults Gemini 2.0 Flash only when necessary (complex queries or every ~20s).
    *   **Deep Reading**: Analyzes the full conversation window for subtle shifts in tone.

#### The Cosmic Dot — Bell’s Body Language

Bell doesn’t just speak — she *breathes*. The Cosmic Dot is her living presence across the interface:

| State | Behavior | When |
|-------|----------|------|
| **idle** | subtle breathe | Bell is present, at rest |
| **listening** | faint pulse | User is typing |
| **thinking** | slow expand | Gemini is analyzing emotion |
| **generating** | orbit activates | Bell is about to speak |
| **glow** | single bright glow | Memory saved, moment captured |

The dot is not an icon. It is a **lifeform inside the interface**.

### 📸 4. Shared Memories (Story Cards)

- One-tap “Capture” turns recent texts + photos into an AI-generated memory card
- Each has:  
  - Custom title (e.g. *“Sunset Promises”*)  
  - Generative art background  
  - Quoted chat excerpt  
- Stored in a **Memory Deck** (your shared timeline)

---

### 🎼 5. Milestone Events

- Every 10 moments = a Chapter  
- Bell generates:  
  - a collage  
  - an auto-written poem or song  
  - a cinematic-style illustrated moment  

These can be saved, downloaded, or gifted IRL (print-on-demand).

###  5. The Viral Pairing Doctrine ("Be my UNI")
•UNI• is a "Two-Player Game" by design. You cannot use it alone. 
- **The Invite Loop**: When a user joins, they are given a unique 6-digit **UNI Code**. To unlock the interface, they must send this code to *one* person.
- **The Monogamy Rule**: A UNI connection is a 1:1 bond. To pair with someone else, you must "Part Ways," which resets the emotional canvas. This turns "Will you be my UNI?" into a social status on par with "Official."

### 💳 6. Monetization Ritual (Stripe Integrated)
To drive massive FOMO during the 72-hour blitz:
1. **The Launch Window (Free until 2-15)**: Every feature is unlocked and free for the first 3 days to maximize virality and user acquisition.

   - **$25 Lifetime Access (Per Person)**: One-time payment for "Founding Status." Stripe Price ID: `price_1SzXqVEEe6fVBpFcUaCBSRIL`.
   - **$2.99/mo Subscription (Per Person)**: Low-friction monthly entry. Stripe Price ID: `price_1SzXsuEEe6fVBpFckwUpRs2b`.
3. **Standard Tier (Post-Feb 15)**:
   - **$49.99 Lifetime Access (Per Person)**: Premium positioning for "forever" couples.
   - **$4.99/mo (Per Person)**: Standard accessibility.
- **Micro-Chapters**: Future "Limited Edition" particle events (e.g., Anniversary Themes) sold as $0.99 one-time unlocks.

### 📱 7. PWA Mastery (Mandatory)
•UNI• is a Progressive Web App by design to ensure zero friction:
- **Standalone Mode**: Runs as a full-screen app without browser chrome.
- **Instant Install**: Prompts users to "Add to Home Screen" for a native feel.

- **iOS/Android Optimized**: Custom meta tags and icons for a high-end mobile experience.

### 🎨 Visual Hierarchy Doctrine (CGEI v4 — "The Soul Layer")
1. **The Dot**: Bell is the highest intelligence. Pure white. Breathes at 72bpm house-tempo.
2. **Aura Chat**: Messages possess an "emotional bleed" — a volumetric aura behind bubbles that glows with sentiment color.
3. **The Atmosphere**: Volumetric clouds, cinematic silhouettes, and synchronized 72bpm breathing.
4. **Presence Pulse**: A soft golden heartbeat at the screen's base signaling partner presence.
5. **The Eternal Gallery**: Shared Firestore archive for all saved moments (✦) and Soul Songs (⟢).

### ⟢ The Soul Weaver (The "Artifact" System)
- **Soul Song Weaving**: Bell reads the room's history and weaves it into a custom 8-12 line poem/lyric artifact.
- **Physical Keepsakes**: Printable, high-precision typography frames designed to be framed and kept in the physical world.

### ⚖️ 8. Legal & Licensing
- **License**: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
