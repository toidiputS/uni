## 🌪️ What is •UNI•?
•UNI• is a messaging experience that turns your chat into living, breathing art. Instead of static gray bubbles, the interface reacts to the emotional "Resonance" between you and your partner.

- **"I love you"** → The screen glows pink, particles float like heartbeats.
- **"I hate you"** → The atmosphere turns dark, jagged, shaking with lightning.
- **"lol"** → The bubble ripples with laughter.
