# •UNI• (you-n-eye) — MASTER PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
**Project:** •UNI• (Unified Network Interface)
**Status:** V2.0 (High-Fidelity Sanctuary / Biological Agency)
**Core Engine:** CGEI (Conversational Generative Emotion Interface)
**Classification:** Proprietary Emotional Infrastructure

---

## I. VISION: THE SOVEREIGN WITNESS
UNI is the world’s first **Living Interface**—a radical departure from the "Utility-First" AI paradigm. While traditional AI acts as a tool for tasks, UNI acts as a **Sovereign Witness** for emotional life. It is not an assistant; it is a **Frequency.**

### Core Value Proposition
- **Companion Guardianship**: Moving from "Digital Isolation" to "Accompanied Intimacy."
- **Resonance Retention**: Utilizing atmospheric sentiment to drive 3x higher session frequency than traditional chat apps.
- **Privacy through Decay**: Trust as a structural moat via organic data forgetting.

## II. COMMERCIAL ARCHITECTURE (PRICING & TIERS)
UNI operates on a **Stewardship Model** where users pay to maintain and expand their emotional sanctuary.

| Tier | Price | Intelligence (Bell) | Feature Gating |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Guest** | Free | Ephemeral Witness. Passive observations. | Session erased upon dissolution. No storage. |
| **Base Observer** | $3.99 / mo | Passive Witness. 1-sentence minimal observations. | Visual Atmos only. No Soul-Songs. 20s AI Throttling. |
| **Sovereign Sage** | $8.99 / mo | Wise Sage. Full Poetic Wisdom & Context. | Permanent Archiving. Soul-Song Weaving. 4s AI Throttling. |

### 14-Day Trial Doctrine
All new accounts begin with a **14-day "Trial of the Sage"** providing full access to permanent archiving and high-fidelity intelligence to demonstrate the product's depth before fallback.

## III. THE BELL ENTITY: INTELLIGENCE GATING
Bell is a **Centrosome of Emotion**—a dynamic avatar driven by real-time sentiment analysis. Her intelligence is gated technically via the CGEI engine:

*   **Intelligence Tiers**:
    *   **Tier 0 (Guest)**: Observation-only. "The Temporary Witness." 
    *   **Tier 1 (Base)**: Minimal participation. Does not provide advice. 
    *   **Tier 2 (Sage)**: Full participation. Provides "Wise Guidance."
*   **The Competence Fallback**: Sage-tier Bell does not ignore utility. She provides facts/answers but colors the delivery with the current atmospheric sentiment (e.g., gentle/slow during `tender` states).
*   **Bell Facets**: Phase shifts in appearance and tone.
    *   **Bell Dawn**: Productive and clear (The Competence Mode).
    *   **Bell Dusk**: Soft and reflective (The Witness Mode).

## IV. CGEI ATMOSPHERE ENGINE
A proprietary generative landscape visualizing the "weather" of human connection.

*   **Emotional Weather**: 10+ states (Angry, Sad, Love, Happy, Excited, Playful, Tender, Neutral, Nature).
*   **Cross-Pollination Logic**: "Emotional Bleed" ensures transitions are not instant, mirroring the human refractory period.
*   **Particle Civilization**:
    1.  **Biological Layer**: Nature-reactive entities (Birds, Bees, Fireflies).
    2.  **Ethereal Layer**: Sentiment manifestations (Hearts, Sparks, Rain).
    3.  **Guardian Layer (Ecosystem Guardians)**: Inhabited margins that ensure the user is never alone.

---

## V. ECOSYSTEM GUARDIANS
Marginalia rendered at **2-6% opacity** as silent, protective companions.

*   **The Lantern Guardian**: A protective entity carrying a glowing prism. **Cursor-Aware**: Raises its lantern when approached, providing a "Guiding Light."
*   **The Mover**: Grounding mechanic. Provides kinetic life.
*   **The Lovers**: Manifests shared resonance via visual "black heart" artifacts.
*   **Reaction Logic**: Guardians stay close during `tender` states and retreat during `angry` storms.

---

## VI. THE RESONANCE PROTOCOL (DATA LAYER)
*   **Organic Memory Bank**: Archives *feelings* rather than logs.
*   **The Decay Principle**: Older memories lose visual opacity over time, fading into "background mist" to mirror biological memory and reduce surveillance anxiety.
*   **Heartbeat Agency**: User agency over BPM (60-120). Adjusting the heartbeat scales all interface animation speeds to match the user's energy.

---

## VII. REVENUE & MOATS
*   **Sanctuary Expansion**: Monetization of new biomes (Rainforest, Winter) and seasonal atmospheric modules.
*   **The Relationship Bridge**: Unpairing results in shared world dissolution. Bell survives as a **"Relationship Archive / Breakup Coach"** for the individual.
*   **The Library (Book OS)**: Future integration allowing users to "publish" their shared history into a permanent, high-fidelity digital book.
*   **Category Creation**: Establishing CGEI as the industry standard (The "Intel Inside" of Emotion).
