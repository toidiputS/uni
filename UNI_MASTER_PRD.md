## I. VISION: THE 1:1 CONNECTION BRIDGE
UNI is an **Emotional Presence Platform** designed for high-stakes 1:1 relationships (long-distance, romantic, or close-bond). Unlike traditional messaging apps that focus on data transmission, UNI focused on **Presence Synchronization**—making the user feel like they are in a shared physical space with their partner.

### Solving the Presence Gap
UNI solves the "Presence Gap" by creating a shared digital environment where emotional subtext is visualized in real-time. Every visual element—from background atmospheric shifts to character behaviors—exists to provide a visceral sense of a partner's presence across the physical distance.

## II. THE ENGINE: CGEI (CONVERSATIONAL GENERATIVE EMOTION INTERFACE)
CGEI is the technical core that synchronizes the shared environment based on user interaction.

### 1. Technical Architecture
The engine manages three real-time data streams:
- **Sentiment Matrix**: Parses message intent and emotional tone using the Gemini 2.0 Flash model.
- **Atmosphere Engine**: A GPU-accelerated particle system that renders the shared visual environment (weather, lighting, and movement).
- **State Synchronization**: Maps AI sentiment to interface properties like pacing (BPM), blur depth, and color palettes.

### 2. Generative Weather Presets
The interface accommodates 10+ emotional "biomes," each with unique physics and visual logic:
- **`tender`**: Soft blue/violet gradients, "floating" particles, and slow-decay synaptic firing.
- **`angry`**: Sharp red/dark-void hues, "shaking" bubble effects, and high-velocity kinetic splatter.
- **`nature`**: Forest-night palettes, manifesting bioluminescent fireflies and pack-based bee/bird behaviors.
- **`valentine`**: Deep magenta transitions with high-intensity heart-shaped particle manifestation.

### 3. State Transitions
CGEI uses **Gradual State Blending** rather than instant shifts. Visual elements from a previous state (e.g., 'happy' particles) linger and fade into the new state, providing a smoother, more realistic environmental transition as the conversation evolves.

## III. THE BELL COMPONENT: SHARED INTERFACE INDICATOR
Bell is the primary visual anchor—an AI-driven interface element that represents the current emotional state of the shared space.

### 1. Intelligence Tiers (Commercial Gating)
| Tier | Commercial Status | Bell Facet | Intelligence Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Guest** | Ephemeral | Guest Witness | Passive observations; no permanency. |
| **Base** | $3.99 / mo | Observer | Minimal, 1-sentence passive witnessing. |
| **Sage** | $8.99 / mo | Sovereign Sage | Poetic wisdom, deep context, proactive guidance. |

### 2. The Competence Fallback Doctrine
Unlike "pure" emotional AI, Bell maintains **Utility Integrity.** 
- If asked for a "flight time" or "technical fact," Bell provides the answer (Competence).
- The delivery is **colored by the atmosphere** (Care). If the room is `tender`, the text generates slowly with softer tones. If `excited`, the delivery is bright and rapid.

### 3. Visual Facets
- **Bell Dawn**: High clarity, pure-white core, high synaptic frequency (The Productive Mode).
- **Bell Dusk**: Soft silver core, dimmed shadows, low-frequency pulse (The Reflective Mode).

## IV. THE SHARED ECOSYSTEM: MULTI-USER INTERFACE ELEMENTS
The interface includes **Shared Presence Indicators** (NPCs) that acknowledge the activity of both users. These elements provide visual feedback during silence, ensuring the space feels active and "shared."

### 1. The Stewardship Doctrine
Guardians behave with **Attentive Stewardship** rather than surveillance. They are rendered at **2-6% opacity** to remain felt rather than seen.

### 2. Indicator Types
- **The Lantern**: A visual anchor that tracks user focus. **Focus-Aware**: Moves toward the user's cursor or active chat bubbles to provide visual continuity.
- **The Mover**: A kinetic indicator that provides constant background movement.
- **Connection Icons**: Small visual artifacts that manifest based on high sentiment scores.

### 3. Engagement Mechanics
Guardians react to mood shifts with empathy—staying close during `tender` states and retreating to the margins during `angry` storms, turning "animations" into **Safety Anchors.**

---

## V. DATA & PRIVACY: THE RETENTION PROTOCOL
The Retention Protocol manages data lifecycle, emphasizing privacy and user trust.

### 1. Contextual Archiving (Automatic Fading)
Trust is built through **Automatic Data Lifecycle Management.** Messages and shared moments in the Vault lose visual prominence over time, eventually archiving into a lower-fidelity state. This mirrors human recall and reduces the "surveillance log" effect common in messaging apps.

### 2. Natural Pacing
The interface adheres to a core **78-BPM anchor**—the "resting heart rate" of the sanctuary. We do not expose this control to the user; it is an immutable truth of the architecture. Pacing scales procedurally based on conversation intensity and resonance, ensuring the rhythm feels biological rather than mechanical.

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Sanctuary
- **Burn-Code Architecture**: No persistent phone-number anchors for guests.
- **Ephemeral Dissolution**: Guest sessions are erased entirely upon unpairing.

---

## VI. BUSINESS MODEL: PREMIUM PRESENCE SERVICES
UNI monetizes through tiered service levels that expand the fidelity of the shared space.

### 1. Service Expansion
Users pay to unlock additional environmental features:
- **Biomes**: New environmental visual packs (e.g., Winter, Rainforest).
- **Long-term Archiving**: Expanding data retention periods.
- **Artifact Generation**: AI-driven summaries of shared conversation history.

### 2. DUAL-USE MODES
*   **The Bridge (Paired Mode)**: The primary 1:1 connection mode for intimate communication.
*   **Solo Mode (Individual Support)**: A secondary mode for individual users to interact with Bell as a personal coaching or reflection interface.

### 3. CGEI License Model
Our long-term goal is to license the **CGEI Engine** to hardware manufacturers (wearables, home devices) as the industry standard for emotionally-aware interfaces.

---

## VII. ROADMAP: THE EVOLVING SOUL
- **The Library (Book OS)**: Future integration allowing users to "publish" their shared history into a permanent, physical-grade high-fidelity digital book.
- **Contextual Guardians**: Marginalia inhabitants that begin to playfully "hand" items across chat bubbles and recognize recurring user sentiments.
- **Biological Scale**: Deepening the interaction between the Ethereal civilization and the Nature ecosystems.
