# Speed Insights Integration

Successfully integrated Vercel Speed Insights into the •UNI• application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- **Modified**: `package.json`
  - Added `@vercel/speed-insights` version `^1.3.1` as a dependency
- **Modified**: `package-lock.json`
  - Updated lockfile to reflect the new package and its 153 dependencies

### 2. Component Integration
- **Modified**: `src/App.jsx`
  - Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react';`
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component at the end of the main app component (line 221)
  - Positioned after the audio element and before the closing div tag

## Implementation Details

The integration follows the recommended approach for React applications as outlined in the Vercel Speed Insights documentation:

1. The `SpeedInsights` component is imported from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
2. The component is placed in the root App component to track all routes/pages
3. The component automatically handles tracking performance metrics once deployed to Vercel

## Verification

- ✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
- ✅ No build errors or warnings
- ✅ Dependencies installed correctly
- ✅ Code follows existing patterns and conventions

## Next Steps

After deployment to Vercel:
1. Speed Insights will automatically begin tracking performance metrics
2. The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script will be available in the deployed app
3. Data can be viewed in the Vercel dashboard under the Speed Insights tab
4. Performance metrics will be visible after users visit the site

## Notes

- The integration is minimal and non-invasive
- No changes to existing functionality or user experience
- The SpeedInsights component only loads on production/Vercel deployments
- Local development is unaffected by this integration
